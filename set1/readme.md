TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 1: Since I dont have much history with coding so all of these apps and key words are pretty new to me. I am getting my head around the basic terms like loop and def. Its pretty fun but also confusing. Reflecting on the code we did in class, it represents a quintessential starting point for anyone learning Python. The task of writing a Python script to print "Hello world!" is a classic exercise that serves multiple purposes. It introduces new programmers (such as myself) to the basic syntax of Python, the use of print statements, and the process of running a script. This exercise is deliberately simple, aiming to build confidence and establish a foundational understanding. Moreover, it shows that even the most complex software begins with a single line of code. By following the instructions and consulting the provided course website, learners engage with essential resources and practices that will support their journey into more advanced programming concepts. All of this layed the groundwork for future learning and problem-solving skills in the realm of programming. This class will be fun.
