TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Reflecting on this lesson, I realized how fundamental concepts in programming can be combined to solve more complex problems. Each function built upon the previous one, teaching us not only to write functional code but also to understand the underlying logic. The `loop_ranger` function introduced us to using loops to create custom ranges, emphasizing how control structures work in Python. It was a good exercise in understanding iteration and manually controlling the flow of the loop, which is essential for grasping more complex algorithms later on.

The `two_step_ranger`, `stubborn_asker`, and `not_number_rejector` functions added layers of complexity by incorporating user input and validation. These functions taught us to handle real-world scenarios where input might not always be as expected, reinforcing the importance of error handling and input validation. Combining these concepts in the `super_asker` function showed how modular and reusable code can simplify solving more comprehensive tasks. It was satisfying to see how each piece fit together to form a robust solution that covered all bases.

The binary search algorithm was the highlight, introducing a classic algorithmic approach to efficiently narrow down a search space. It required a good understanding of conditional statements and loops, demonstrating how powerful these basic constructs can be when used correctly. The process of guessing, checking, and adjusting the search range until the correct number was found illustrated the divide-and-conquer strategy effectively. This lesson emphasized the importance of clear logic and debugging skills, particularly in understanding how each part of the code contributes to the overall function. Using Visual Studio's debugging tools made it easier to step through the code, inspect variables, and understand the flow of the program. Overall, this lesson was a comprehensive introduction to fundamental programming concepts and their practical applications, laying a solid foundation for more advanced topics.
